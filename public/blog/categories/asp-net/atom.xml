<p>I just gave a webinar yesterday for <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/">JP Boodhoo’s</a> <a href="http://webinars.developwithpassion.com/">Develop With Passion® webinar series</a> on Compositional and Convention-based Web Development with <a href="http://fubumvc.com/">FubuMVC</a>. The recorded session is now posted online with a slew of referenced and related links. I apologize for the sound quality and will make corrections if I get another chance to do another webinar/screencast. Here is the link to the recording:</p>  <p><a href="http://webinars.developwithpassion.com/webinars/3">http://webinars.developwithpassion.com/webinars/3</a></p>  <p>I didn’t mention this in the screencast but before we began switching our company’s production website to FubuMVC, we first devised a way to get the benefit of <a href="http://murrayon.net/2011/06/fubumvc-behavior-chains-bmvc-pattern.html">FubuMVC Behavior Chains</a> while still on the ASP.NET MVC framework.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>For the last several months at work, we have been gradually migrating our production website to use the .NET open source <a href="http://fubumvc.com/" target="_blank">FubuMVC web framework</a>. Before committing to a whole new infrastructure for our site, some brilliant talent on our team decided to improve our experience on the ASP.NET MVC framework by integrating in one of FubuMVC’s most compelling features, behavior chains. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bob_pace" target="_blank">Bob Pace</a> originally blogged about the process in a two part blog post series (<a href="http://paceyourself.net/2010/08/06/integrating-fubumvc-with-aspnet-mvc-part-1/" target="_blank">part 1</a> and <a href="http://paceyourself.net/2010/08/13/integrating-fubumvc-with-aspnet-mvc-part-2/" target="_blank">part 2</a>); since then, he has <a href="https://github.com/bobpace/MvcToFubu" target="_blank">created a packaged solution called MvcToFubu</a> which he <a href="http://paceyourself.net/2011/06/11/mvctofubu---transition-your-website-from-aspnet-mvc-to-fubumvc-part-1/" target="_blank">just recently started another blog post series about</a>.</p>  <p>Behavior chains are by far my favorite feature of FubuMVC. I believe they single-handedly revolutionized our use of the MVC pattern in a web environment. In fact, I like to think of it as a whole new pattern, the <strong>BMVC Pattern</strong> (I was told by a coworker that the ‘B’ should stand for “Better”, and while that’s true, I’ll stick with “Behaviors”). No, I’m not sincerely trying to coin yet another design or architectural pattern buzzword. However, I am most sincerely not joking when I say behavior chains add a whole new dimension to how I design web architectures. I find myself creating composable pipelines of cohesive, testable components in lieu of monolithic controllers and actions.</p> <span class="fullpost">   <h3>What are Behavior Chains?</h3>    <p>Have you ever looked at your controller actions and thought “Man, there’s a lot going on here!” (validation, authorization, transactions, ORM setup, logging, caching, etc.)? If you haven’t, I urge you to take a conscious look at your controller actions and try to identify code that doesn’t <u>directly</u> relate to the purpose of the page (or sub-view of the page). Shouldn’t there be a way to move some of this secondary infrastructure code out of our controller actions and have it be applied conventionally to the correct actions/routes? Yes, and this is exactly what Behavior Chains are meant to accomplish, the ability to create composable pipelines of reusable behavior nodes for each route in your site.</p>    <p>Behavior chains can be built up in any order you want for each route via Conventions and Policies, which are extension points that allow you to inspect and modify the entire Behavior Graph that was built by FubuMVC during startup bootstrapping. The behavior graph is the modifiable collection of all behavior chains in the site, initially built with just a few default behavior nodes for each route. A typical behavior chain by default usually has an ActionCall node (representing the call to a controller action) and an Output node (often a tie-in to a view rendering engine, but can also be JSON or anything else). Other behavior nodes can be sprinkled into the pipeline in any order in front of or in between the ActionCall and the Output nodes. As mentioned before via the use of Conventions and Policies, it is common practice to filter your list of behavior chains using LINQ extension methods and then add a specific behavior node into the matching chains at a specific location in the chain. This truly elevates coding to conventions to a new level; some of the filtering criteria regarding controller actions that you may come up with could be as follows:</p>    <ul>     <li>Action method names that contain a certain word. </li>      <li>Actions methods that are located in a particular controller or namespace. </li>      <li>Action method signatures that contain an input/output model that implements a specific interface. </li>      <li>Action method signatures that contain an input/output model that contains a property of a certain type or have a particular C# attribute applied to it. </li>      <li>So on, so forth…whatever you can dream up! </li>   </ul>    <p>One more aspect of behavior chains that is important to point out is the logistics in how behavior nodes are chained together. The chains are not merely a linked-list of behavior nodes that are traversed linearly. Instead the makeup of the chains is better conceptualized to be an outer behavior node wrapping around an inner behavior node, which is then itself an outer node wrapped around another inner node, and so on. In fact, the FubuMVC developers like to refer to this chaining architecture as the Onion Layer Model or the Russian Doll Model (conjuring up a mental image of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">nesting Russian doll toy called a matryoshka doll or a babushka doll</a>). When an outer behavior node has finished executing it’s logic, it can then optionally execute it’s inner behavior node logic (or stop the behavior chain entirely in order to return early with a response, an error, or even transfer to a different route and behavior chain). One of the key advantages that this wrapping architecture can afford is the ability for an outer behavior to run additional logic or clean up code after all inner behavior nodes have completed (i.e., transactions can be committed, connections can be closed, sessions can be disposed, etc.).</p>    <h3>How does this change the way I code my controllers?</h3>    <p>I find that my controller actions are much thinner and more focused on the base case and the successful code path. All the exceptional code paths and edge cases have been identified and deal with by the other behavior nodes in the chain, prior to my action call being invoked. My action call can now focus on the essential logic that differentiate this route from others. That essential logic doesn’t get lost anymore in the necessary infrastructure code that should be a secondary concern. And all of this logic can be broken up into cohesive, reusable components within a flexible request/response pipeline that can be built up automatically by coding to whatever conventions you deem beneficial. Behavior chains really do add a whole new first-class citizen to the MVC design pattern. Do yourself a favor and check out the MvcToFubu solution mentioned at the top of this post, and bring some FubuMVC behavior chain goodness to your ASP.NET MVC website. I think you might be as impressed as we were and yearn for <a href="http://lostechies.com/chadmyers/2011/05/30/cool-stuff-in-fubucore-and-fubumvc-series/">the other killer features of FubuMVC</a> as well.</p> </span>  </div>

Thanks for thought! Perhaps I&#39;ll post on the mailing list and see what others think about it being involved in the FubuMVC documentation somewhere.</div>

Great post, I didn&#39;t see this one when I was writing my post about authentication behavior. This is a great explanation of behavior chains in FubuMVC.<br /><br />This would also be a great intro to behaviors for the fubumvc guides.</div>

<p>Off and on for the last six months, I have probably seen and read at least a half dozen introductions and tutorials on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monads</a>, a functional programming construct based on the mathematical monads from category theory.&#160; Monads are known for their headache-inducing explanations, and I’ve had my fair share.&#160; Every tutorial I’ve committed time to mentions the endless possibilities of using such constructs to improve your code, but I’ve had a hard time finding real-world examples of using this stuff out in the wild (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/866912/what-is-the-compelling-scenario-for-using-monads-in-c">much like this Stack Overflow poster</a>, whose link I only found just now).&#160; It has recently become a quest of mine to find some C# code we all write that could be improved by a monad.</p>  <p>I am now going to attempt to introduce a Maybe monad that I cooked up, but I warn you that I have no idea what I’m doing or if I’m staying within the rules for what makes a monad by definition a monad.&#160; Don’t worry though, you have nothing to lose; I’m the only one taking a risk at looking foolish, and it’s all at the expense of my reputation and not yours.&#160; Should be fun!</p> <span class="fullpost">   <h3>“It is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself”</h3>    <p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Wikipedia article linked to above</a>:</p>    <blockquote>     <p>“In functional programming, a monad is a kind of abstract data type constructor used to represent computations (instead of data in the domain model). Monads allow the programmer to chain actions together to build a pipeline, in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad. Programs written in functional style can make use of monads to structure procedures that include sequenced operations, or to define arbitrary control flows (like handling concurrency, continuations, or exceptions).</p>      <p>…</p>      <p>“A programmer will compose monadic functions to define a data-processing pipeline. The monad acts as a framework, as it's a reusable behavior that decides the order in which the specific monadic functions in the pipeline are called, and manages all the undercover work required by the computation.”</p>   </blockquote>    <p>The promised tenets of monads are increased code readability and algorithm composability, an example of preferring declarative code over imperative, procedural code.&#160; In the case of the Maybe monad, it is a wrapper around types that might have an invalid state like <font face="Courier New">null</font> or <font face="Courier New">nothing</font>.&#160; The lure of the Maybe monad is the ability to deal with values that might be in this invalid state without having to explicitly check for null before continuing or exceptions being thrown in your algorithms.</p>    <p>I first found <a href="http://abdullin.com/journal/2009/10/6/zen-development-practices-c-maybe-monad.html">a post by Rinat Abdullin</a> where he introduced his version of a C# Maybe monad.&#160; I downloaded the library and attempted to figure out how to use it in code I could possibly write any given day.&#160; I tried mimicking the <font face="Courier New">HttpContext.Request.Params</font> collection commonly used in ASP.NET pages and HTTP handlers to retrieve the passed in query string or post values on the <font face="Courier New">Request</font> object.&#160; If you ask that collection for a parameter that was not passed in on the request, it returns a null instead of the string value.&#160; Common practice is to then use a bunch of <font face="Courier New">if</font> statements and key off the fact that certain query string or post parameters may or may not exist.</p>    <p>The problem I ran into with Rinat’s implemenation is that I wrote the code using the monad how I thought it should help me, and then ran into compiler errors and runtime exceptions because of the expectation that Maybe objects couldn’t be constructed around null values.&#160; Here is the twitter conversation I had with Rinat in regard to this misconception that I had:</p>   <span style="widows: 2; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; border-collapse: separate; font: medium &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; letter-spacing: normal; color: rgb(0,0,0); word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px" class="Apple-style-span"><span style="font-family: verdana, tahoma, arial, &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;, sans-serif, georgia, courier, &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; color: rgb(0,58,126); font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">       <div style="padding-bottom: 15px; background-color: rgb(234,242,249); margin: 0px; padding-left: 15px; width: 550px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 15px; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial" class="post1">         <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; width: 80px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: left; height: 80px; padding-top: 0px" class="avatar"><a style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; color: rgb(0,58,126); text-decoration: none; padding-top: 0px" title="View murrayondotnet&#39;s Twitter Page" href="http://www.twitter.com/murrayondotnet" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid; border-left: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid; padding-bottom: 3px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px; border-top: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid; border-right: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid; padding-top: 3px" alt="murrayondotnet&#39;s avatar" src="http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/547516901/profilepic_bigger.PNG" width="73" height="73" /></a></div>          <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px" class="post">           <h5 style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; font: bold 16px verdana, tahoma, arial, &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;, sans-serif, georgia, courier, &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, serif; color: rgb(98,98,98); padding-top: 0px"><a style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; color: rgb(0,58,126); text-decoration: none; padding-top: 0px" title="View murrayondotnet&#39;s Twitter Page" href="http://www.twitter.com/murrayondotnet" target="_blank">murrayondotnet</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>says:</h5>            <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; width: 450px; padding-right: 0px; font: 14px/19px tahoma, arial; color: rgb(98,98,98); padding-top: 0px" class="mainpost">@abdullin Can you make your MaybeMonad in Lokad lib accept null at construct or explicit/implicit cast?

if (person != null)
{
  if (HasMedicalRecord(person) &amp;&amp; person.Address != null)
  {
    CheckAddress(person.Address);
    if (person.Address.PostCode != null)
      postCode = person.Address.PostCode.ToString();
    else
      postCode = &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;;
  }
}</pre>

  <p>This is actually code that you wrote; I took it just yesterday from your current project at work.&#160; I know you’re feeling a bit defensive because of this, but I’m here to help so put down the attitude please.&#160; We’re gonna make your life easier…I hope…</p>

  <p>All in all, it’s code you see every day and there’s not much really wrong with it per se.&#160; I just think it could be cleaner I suppose.&#160; So using Dmitri’s extension methods, you can get that logic down to this:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">string postCode = this.With(x =&gt; person)
  .If(x =&gt; HasMedicalRecord(x))
  .With(x =&gt; x.Address)
  .Do(x =&gt; CheckAddress(x))
  .With(x =&gt; x.PostCode)
  .Return(x =&gt; x.ToString(), &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;);</pre>

  <p>As long as that last <font face="Courier New">ToString</font> method call doesn’t return a null (which one of my use cases does in the <font face="Courier New">TestConsoleApp</font> included in my source code), you will either get the value or <font face="Courier New">“UNKNOWN”</font>.&#160; Looking good!</p>

  <p>So my version of the Maybe monad comes out pretty close to this last one:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">string postCode = person.If(p =&gt; HasMedicalRecord(p))
  .Access(p =&gt; p.Address)
  .Apply(a =&gt; CheckAddress(a))
  .Access(a =&gt; a.PostCode)
  .Convert(pc =&gt; pc.ToString(), &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;);

// or even
string postalCode = person.If(HasMedicalRecord)
  .Access(p =&gt; p.Address)
  .Apply(CheckAddress)
  .Access(a =&gt; a.PostCode)
  .Convert(pc =&gt; pc.ToString(), &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;);</pre>

  <p>The difference between Dmitri’s and mine being how the chain is first started, on the Maybe <font face="Courier New">person</font> object instead of Dmitri’s use of the <font face="Courier New">this</font> keyword.</p>

  <p>Here’s what you’ve been really waiting for where I eat my own words.&#160; Dmitri’s code can also be written like this:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">string postCode = person.If(HasMedicalRecord)
  .With(x =&gt; x.Address)
  .Do(CheckAddress)
  .With(x =&gt; x.PostCode)
  .Return(x =&gt; x.ToString(), &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;);</pre>

  <p>…which appears to take away any advantage of my library.&#160; I officially like his solution better, I just don’t like some of the method names.&#160; So perhaps <a href="http://murrayon.net/2010/09/maybe-monad-extensions.html" target="_blank">I will create another blog post</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/murrayondotnet/maybemonadextensions/" target="_blank">Bitbucket repo with a new library of extension methods</a> instead.&#160; I will leave up this mess-of-a-post public (as well as the source code) so that perhaps others can see the process I went through and learn from my mistakes.</p>

  <h3>Your Turn to Criticize Now</h3>

  <p>Let me have it.&#160; Let me know how crazy I am or if this is even useful.&#160; Let me know if I’m completely misusing the monad principles.&#160; Or, by some weird miracle, let me know if I’m on to something.&#160; Actually, if Dmitri is on to something.&#160; Either way, I want to hear from you.&#160; Thanks.</p>

<p>I developed an ASP.NET site connecting to a local SQL Server Express 2005 instance on my development box.&#160; To further my informal testing, I wanted to host the site under IIS 7 on a Windows Server 2008 box, but I wanted to just use the same database remotely.&#160; I got the following error message when the site tried to hit the database:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server.&#160; When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections.&#160; (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open connection to SQL Server)&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>Apparently SQL Server Express 2005 is not automatically configured for remote access during installation (which really isn't surprising as it is the Express version).&#160; Remote connections can be enabled though with a few relatively painless steps.&#160; See the following link for the procedure:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.datamasker.com/SSE2005_NetworkCfg.htm">Configuring SQL Server Express 2005 for Remote Access when SQL Server does not allow remote connections</a></li> </ul>  <p>Hope this is helpful.</p>  </div>

<p>I talked at length about the ASP.NET <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provider_model">Provider Model pattern</a> and the ease of implementing several built-in services you can have for free with ASP.NET 2.0 in <a title="ASP.NET Providers - Membership, Role, and Profile" href="http://murrayon.net/2009/01/aspnet-providers-membership-role-and.html">my previous series of posts</a>.&#160; In this post, I will be discussing the advantages of using the ASP.NET Provider system under IIS 7 found in Windows Vista and Server 2008.&#160; I will also talk about an issue with using this Provider system to try and add authentication to an ASP.NET website that contains non-ASP.NET content, like static HTML pages.&#160; I think I'll start with the discussion about non-ASP.NET content first.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <h3>IIS 7.0 Integrated Pipeline</h3>  <p>Since I don't really understand much about <a title="Internet Server Application Programming Interface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAPI">ISAPI</a> filters and such, I'm just going to quote stuff from random pages on the <a href="http://www.iis.net/">official Microsoft IIS site</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;IIS 6.0 and previous versions allowed the development of .NET application components via the ASP.NET platform. ASP.NET integrated with IIS via an ISAPI extension, and exposed its own application and request processing model. This effectively exposed two separate server pipelines, one for native ISAPI filters and extension components, and another for managed application components. ASP.NET components would execute entirely inside the ASP.NET ISAPI extension bubble and only for requests mapped to ASP.NET in the IIS script map configuration.</p>    <p>&quot;IIS 7.0 integrates the ASP.NET runtime with the core web server, providing a unified request processing pipeline that is exposed to both native and managed components known as modules.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>and...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;This allows developers to fully extend the IIS 7.0 server with the richness of ASP.NET 2.0 and the .NET Framework, instead of using the lower level IIS C++ APIs. Existing ASP.NET applications also immediately benefit from tighter integration using existing ASP.NET features like Forms Authentication, Roles, and Output Caching for all content.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>Note the last three words there:&#160; &quot;<font face="Courier New">for all content.</font>&quot;&#160; When I started this endeavor to implement the ASP.NET Provider system, I didn't realize that it would really only apply to ASP.NET content and pages.&#160; I didn't realize on IIS 6 I would have to fiddle with ISAPI filters and content filters to make my implementation work.&#160; And when I tried to doing a mapping (like <font face="Courier New">*.html</font> to the ASP.NET ISAPI DLL), I either didn't do it right or it just isn't very reliable and stable; here is a link to <a title="IIS problems with forms authentication &amp; HTML pages" href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1184547.aspx">the thread I followed in trying to make the appropriate changes in IIS 6</a>.&#160; I will note however that <a href="http://www.ultidev.com/products/Cassini/index.htm">UltiDev's Cassini Web Server</a> can host such a site with absolutely no extra modification, where even IIS 7 required a little configuration.</p>  <p>By default in IIS 7, an <a title="IIS and ASP.NET: The Application Pool" href="http://www.developer.com/net/asp/article.php/2245511">application pool</a> runs using the <font face="Courier ne">Integrated</font> mode for the <font face="Courier New">Managed Pipeline</font> configuration.&#160; But there is also the option of <font face="Courier New">Classic</font> mode, which is helpful if you are needing strict compatibility with how you ran a website under IIS 6.&#160; In many cases, however, an existing ASP.NET website runs under <font face="Courier New">Integrated</font> mode without any problems.</p>  <h3>Configuring an ASP.NET Website to Run on IIS 7</h3>  <p>First, I think I will point you to a great video and document on Microsoft's official IIS site that explains everything you really need to know.&#160; Then I will emphasize a few of the important points and also a gotcha or two.&#160; Here are the links you should reference:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/377/using-aspnet-forms-authentication/">Using ASP.NET Forms Authentication</a> (video) </li>    <li><a href="http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/243/aspnet-integration-with-iis7/">ASP.NET Integration with IIS 7.0</a> </li> </ul>  <p>The video above is also a terrific introduction to IIS 7.&#160; Below is a screenshot of IIS's UI for configuring a website:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SZtZDNleinI/AAAAAAAAACw/b2kq_6XIGD8/s1600-h/IIS_screenshot%5B5%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="IIS_screenshot" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SZtZDjlrIRI/AAAAAAAAAC0/cC29GwiAIhk/IIS_screenshot_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="475" height="368" /></a> </p>  <p>Notice the <font face="Courier New">ASP.NET</font> section and how it's able to use your Providers to bring back Users, Roles, and Profile data back from the database.&#160; This UI reads from and writes to your <font face="Courier New">Web.config</font> and is really slick in my opinion.</p>  <p>The only real &quot;breaking change&quot; for running your website under IIS 7 is the fact that your <font face="Courier New">Web.config</font> might need a little migration to be compatible with <font face="Courier New">Integrated</font> mode.&#160; Apparently IIS gives you helpful error messages if it detects you haven't run through the migration yet.&#160; The two most common things that ASP.NET websites have that require this migration are if you have declared <font face="Courier New">httpModules</font> or <font face="Courier New">httpHandlers</font> in your <font face="Courier New">Web.config</font>.&#160; The fix is to either copy or move these sections under <font face="Courier New">system.web</font> to their corresponding <font face="Courier New">system.webServer</font> sections.&#160; If you duplicate the sections, then you should be able run under both <font face="Courier New">Integrated</font> and <font face="Courier New">Classic</font> modes without any problems.&#160; You can even still run on IIS 6 I believe, as IIS 6 will ignore this new section called <font face="Courier New">system.webServer</font> which is IIS 7 specific.&#160; IIS 7 even provides a utility that can perform this migration for you; here is the what you would type in a Command Prompt:</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">%windir%\system32\inetsrv\APPCMD.EXE migrate config &lt;Application Path&gt;</font></p>  <p>...where <font face="Courier New">&lt;Application Path&gt;</font> would be something like <font face="Courier New">&quot;Default Web Site/&quot;</font> or <font face="Courier New">&quot;Default Web Site/someApp&quot;</font>.&#160; If you manually migrate your <font face="Courier New">Web.config</font> and are still getting migration error messages, here is a snippet you can add right under the <font face="Courier New">system.webServer</font> node to disable the error message:</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">&lt;validation validateIntegratedModeConfiguration=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;</font></p>  <p>Also, I want to make note of something I couldn't get to work that they showed in the tutorial video.&#160; At about the <font face="Courier New">13:50</font> mark in the video, they go into the <font face="Courier New">Modules</font> section of the UI.&#160; These are the modules of the IIS pipeline for both managed .NET code and unmanaged code.&#160; In order to make their video file hidden behind ASP.NET Forms Authentication, they change a property on two authentication modules to allow these modules to execute on non-managed content as well.&#160; However, this did not work for me for some reason when I was trying to secure HTML pages behind Forms Authentication.&#160; What did work for me (and may have been a drastic solution) was to put the following attribute on the <font face="Courier New">modules</font> node under <font face="Courier New">system.webServer</font>:</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">&lt;modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;</font></p>  <p>I believe the issue in my case was their was another few managed modules that I needed to clear that checkbox for in the UI.&#160; But I didn't take the time to find out which ones I was missing and opted for the drastic solution.&#160; I will also say there is a way to configure these managed modules through your <font face="Courier New">Web.config</font> so you don't have to have your IT Admin configure properties manually in the UI.&#160; In fact, it seems that much of IIS 7 configuration for your website can be done this way.</p>  <h3>A Few Error Messages (and Their Solutions)</h3>  <p>If you get error messages while using the IIS Manager user interface like this...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;This feature cannot be used because the default provider type could not be determined to check whether it is a trusted provider.</p>    <p>&quot;You can use this feature only when the default provider is a trusted provider.&#160; If you are a server administrator, you can make a provider a trusted provider by adding the provider type to the trusted providers list in the Administration.config file.&#160; The provider has to be strongly typed and added to the GAC (Global Assembly Cache).&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>...then you should visit the following article for detailed information about resolving the error message:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.iis.net/ConfigReference/system.webServer/management/trustedProviders/add">Adding Management Trusted Providers &lt;add&gt;</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Getting rid of this error message is really only for convenience in letting the IIS Manager UI be able to query your database using your providers and give you a basic view of your Membership, Roles, and Profile fields.&#160; Also, if you are trying to find your <font face="Courier New">Administration.config</font> file, it is likely located under the <font face="Courier New">C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\</font> folder.</p>  <p>The other error message I received was not in the IIS Manager UI, but rather when you attempt to view your website in a browser (after you think you got all the configuration bugs out!).&#160; A <font face="Courier New">BadImageFormatException</font> is thrown and the error details say something like this:</p>  <p><font face="Courier New">Could not load file or assembly 'AssemlyNameHere' or one of its dependencies.&#160; An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.</font></p>  <p>The likely cause of this error is that the assembly referenced in the error message was compiled only for 32-bit machines and you are running a 64-bit operating system.&#160; With Windows Server 2008 x64, the application pools in IIS have an <font face="Courier New">Advanced Setting</font> called <font face="Courier New">Enable 32-Bit Applications</font>, that is disabled by default.&#160; Enable this setting and you're probably good to go.&#160; See the following link for more detailed information and some nice screenshots:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://blog.crowe.co.nz/archive/2007/11/05/Could-not-load-file-or-assembly-name-or-one-of.aspx">Could not load file or assembly 'name' or one of its dependencies</a> </li> </ul>  <h3>Additional Reading</h3>  <p>I just barely noticed that <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/">4GuysFromRolla.com</a> recently posted an article about the exact same stuff I was attempting to explain.&#160; To read additional details about IIS 7's Integrated Pipeline and ASP.NET Forms Authentication with static content, check out the following link:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/122408-1.aspx">Apply ASP.NET Authentication and Authorization Rules to Static Content with IIS 7.0's Integrated Pipeline Feature</a> </li> </ul>  <h3>Conclusion</h3>  <p>I hope you've enjoyed <a title="ASP.NET Providers - Membership, Role, and Profile" href="http://murrayon.net/2009/01/aspnet-providers-membership-role-and.html">this series on the ASP.NET Provider System</a>.&#160; My desire is that you've found these posts helpful in getting you started with implementing such a versatile and customizable model for adding common membership and authorization functionality to your new and existing websites.&#160; There are quite a few advantages in hosting your site on IIS 7 in Windows Server 2008, as I've outlined in this specific post.&#160; Hopefully these discussions about errors and gotchas will also help you get going in no time!</p> </span>  </div>
