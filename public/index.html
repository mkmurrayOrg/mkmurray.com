		<p><em>Author&#8217;s Note: I do not take credit for the phrase used as the title of this
blog post. It comes from Gary&#8217;s Ruby Conf 12 video recording entitled
<u>Boundaries</u> mentioned below and in the previous blog post.</em></p>

<p>In the last blog post <a href="/blog/2012/12/08/testing-trade-offs/">Testing
Trade-offs</a>, I talked about the
difficulties of verifying the decisions and dependencies of our classes with the
current mainstream testing methodologies. Based on a recorded conference talk by
<a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt</a>, the focus was on
effectively testing the logic a class contains and the dependent collobrators it
takes in for coordinating with other classes and objects to perform its
responsibilities. Mixing the two concerns in the same object definition requires
utilizing both isolated unit testing and integration/integrated testing in order
to adequately test cover the class. However, code designed this way seems to
play to the weaknesses of each testing strategy just as much as it plays to
their strengths (please see the previous blog post if you would like more
details on that discussion).</p>

<p>Today let&#8217;s go one step further and talk about ways that we could more cleanly
separate the concerns of decisions and dependencies, with the hope that we can
create objects that better lend themselves to one type of testing over the
other. Gary proposes that a such a codebase could have better modularity,
scalability, and even concurrency. I assert that your code will also be more
maintainable and extensible as well. Most of today&#8217;s content will take a lesson
from the functional programming paradigm, including practices they have espoused
for decades.</p>

<h2>Frictionless Isolated Unit Testing</h2>

<p>If you wanted to test the mathematical addition operator (i.e., the plus sign
<code>+</code>), what frameworks, tools, and/or coding tricks do you have to employ to
sufficiently isolate it from all other concerns and objects? Absolutely nothing!
There are no dependencies to mock or stub; it isolates for free. Why is that?
Gary cautions against assuming it is because the addition operator is simple and
lacks complexity. He digs deeper in order to identify two properities the
implementation of plus sign exhibits that allows it to be naturally isolated.</p>

<p>The first property is that the operator takes values as arguments and returns
new values as output without any mutation. The second property is that the
operator requires no dependencies in order to perform its computation and logic.
Thus there is nothing to mock or stub when testing it, which was the major
weakness of isolated unit testing. Also because of the lack of dependencies, no
integrated tests are required in order to better test how the operator will
behave in a production environment where there are no mocks and stubs. To test
the addition operator we merely need to write simple pass-values-in,
assert-value-out tests with no extra setup required.</p>

<p>As Gary applies these concepts to existing code, we notice a few changes. Pieces
of domain logic and pieces of code that coordinate dependencies are separated
from each other, broken out into new objects created for a single purpose and
responsibility. The nature of the communication between objects also changed,
with values (inputs and outputs) becoming the boundary between objects instead
of the emphasis being on several synchronous method calls. Value objects focused
on data (and not behavior) become the new contract between collaborating
classes.</p>

<h2>To Be Continued&#8230;</h2>

<p>You may notice that many of these concepts have a functional programming
influence. The properties of immutability and focus on data at the boundaries
allow us to write code that isolates very easily and lends itself very well to
isolated unit testing that is simple and not brittle. It is very good at
verifying the domain logic and decision paths of our objects. Of course, we
can&#8217;t write the entirety of our codebase in this manner with no dependencies
ever. Next time I will discuss a code architecture that Gary proposes which can
utilize this style of code married with some more imperative glue code that
coordinates the dependencies in the system. We will also discuss testing those
portions of code as well.</p>

		<p>Last week our dev team at Extend Health watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs">RubyConf 2012 video of a talk
entitled Boundaries</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary
Bernhardt</a> of <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All
Software</a> (or perhaps even
better known for the infamous <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">WAT lightning talk at CodeMash
2012</a>). Gary proposes a very
interesting code architecture that marries the individual benefits of
immutability &amp; mutability, functional programming &amp; imperative object-oriented
programming, isolated unit testing &amp; integration testing. He discusses the pros
&amp; cons of each code design &amp; testing decision and the trade-offs that we end up
dealing with. He suggests a potential solution that makes virtually no trade-off
and attempts to harness the advantages of each of these methodologies that
appear to be at odds with one another. I feel the idea has a lot of merit and I
highly encourage everyone to watch his presentation to get the full context and
a better logical progression of his proposal than what I can provide.</p>

<h2>Isolated Unit Testing vs. Integration Testing</h2>

<p>A common practice in unit testing classes and objects is to isolate the targeted
class from its dependencies so that you can focus solely on its responsibilities
and domain logic independent of any implementation details of the dependencies.
This is typically accomplished by the use of stubs and mocks, which attempt to
control and monitor the interactions with and data return from dependencies.
There are a ton of gains afforded by this style of testing as Gary points out,
but one very large criticism of this testing methodology is that it doesn&#8217;t
exercise the code in the same way it would run in production. It is not exactly
rare to have these isolated unit tests successfully pass and yet still have
problems in production.</p>

<p>Integration testing tends to better emulate production because it maintains the
interaction relationships between objects in addition to acquiring and passing
the data around the system in the same way. The criticism Gary puts forth of an
integrated testing strategy is that it is very slow as you begin to attempt to
cover all the code paths through the system. Consider trying to cover all
logical branches through the system, including all branches of
try/catch/finally, conditional, and looping structures. Gary suggests the growth
in code to cover these scenarios is 2<sup>n<sup>,</sup></sup> where <code>n</code> is the number of branches.</p>

<p>Many try to get the benefits of both types of testing in order to compensate for
each strategy&#8217;s shortcomings. However, they still write code that doesn&#8217;t play
to each testing methodolgy&#8217;s strengths. The strength of isolated unit testing is
verifying that given certain inputs the expected output is always returned. The
strength of integration testing is coordinating dependencies, making sure they
utilize and interact with the API of other objects correctly. If you design your
classes to be a mix of dependencies and logic, it becomes difficult to
effectively test cover them without writing both sets of tests for all classes
in your codebase.</p>

<h2>So What?</h2>

<p>OK, so you are probably wondering what the point is then. This sounds like a
good plan to just be more disciplined in your test coverage, right? Well, let&#8217;s
explore a way to better segregate dependency orchestration from actual logic and
behavior. This could allow us to use the right testing methodology depending on
which type of responsibility the object is meant to encapsulate: dependencies or
decisions? Gary also asserts that it will lead us down a path that could yield a
codebase with better modularity, scalability, and potentially even concurrency.
I believe you can also add better maintainability and extensibility to that
list.</p>

<p>Next week I will dive into how Gary suggests we can better seperate these
concerns of dependencies and decisions. Stay tuned (or go watch the video and
spoil the surprise).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve known about the new <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords in C# 5 for a while now,
but I saw a use of it I hadn&#8217;t anticipated. I saw Jon Skeet create an
asyncronous lambda expression and was caught a bit off guard. After thinking
about it, it really isn&#8217;t that amazing, but I thought I would spread the word
anyway because I think it could be a really handy feature.</p>

<p>Anonymous functions are declared without a method name and can be passed around
and invoked at will. Lambda expression syntax creates anonymous functions that
can be used as delegates or expression trees. In C# 5, you can adorn functions
with the <code>async</code> keyword which signifies that the function will return a <code>Task</code>
object from the Task Parallel Library as a return value. You will also find
somewhere in the method body the keyword <code>await</code> next to a statement that could
take a while to process and be a blocking operation. Now your method can resume
operation after the asyncronous operation has completed and has its result.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    public void ButtonClick()
    {
        ProcessFiles();
    }

    private async void ProcessFiles()
    {
        var files = new string[] { "file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt" };

        foreach (var file in files)
        {
            var fileContents = await ReadTextAsync(file);
            // likely do something with file contents
        }
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; ReadTextAsync(string filePath)
    {
        // Some text reading implementation that supports the TPL
    }
</pre>


<p>The button click handler method would return at the first sign of a blocking
operation and callback delegates are set up under the covers by the compiler to
finish executing the rest of the code after the blocking process finishes.</p>

<p>Here is the same example but using an async lambda expression:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    public void ButtonClick()
    {
        var files = new string[] { "file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt" };

        files.ForEach(async file => await ReadTextAsync(file));
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; ReadTextAsync(string filePath)
    {
        // Some text reading implementation that supports the TPL
    }
</pre>


<p>Please overlook my disregard of single responsibility and encapsulation, and so
on so forth. This is an overly simplified example intended solely to show what
the syntax looks like. Either way, I could see this lighter weight syntax coming
in handy in the future.</p>

<p>In the same example where I saw async lambda syntax used, I also saw Jon Skeet
show off a really clever extension method that took an enumerable collection of
<code>Task</code> objects and reordered them so they could be enumerated and handled in the
order that they complete their asynchronous operations. Perhaps I will show that
piece of code next time.</p>

		<p>I had the opportunity this week to talk with some terrific Computer Science
students nearing graduation and who were beginning to look for employment. It
provided me the chance to put into words the amazing culture and environment
that exists at my workplace. The software development team at <a href="https://www.extendhealth.com/">Extend
Health</a> is second to none in both talent and
passion for creating clean, modular code that is maintainable because of its
extensibility. Everyone on the team contributes and has a trusted voice. It
truly is an environment I&#8217;ve never seen before and am certainly proud to be
apart of.</p>

<p>One of the main things that hit me while talking to these graduating students
was how well-rounded our developers have come. No, I&#8217;m not talking about the
amount of soda and treats we consume. I&#8217;m referring to the varying skills each
one of us have developed. From front-end to back-end or web sites to desktop
apps, every single member of the team is capable of jumping into any of our
codebases and tackling new features or bugs with a excellent degree of
competentcy. I find this fascinating because it is not the norm at many medium
to large size companies. It is typical for a developer to be hired to a
position or team where he or she works on a single project and codebase for a
few years until they get bored enough to change positions within the company or
go somewhere else completely. This has not been the case for all of the
developers at Extend Health.</p>

<p>We are currently divided into four teams of about four or five devs each. While
each team may have past experience with a certain project or codebase, they are
not automatically the chosen team to work on it again the next time. Because of
this, there is shared knowledge across teams and team members, instead of all
the knowledge residing in only one person&#8217;s head. This avoids the &#8220;what if
someone gets hit by a bus&#8221; problem <a href="http://rhauert.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/the-bus-factor/">my coworker Ryan just blogged
about</a>. The other side
effect is that our developers have all become well-rounded in varying languages
and platforms, solving both front-end and back-end problems. Contrast this with
how I used to classify my dev skill set four or five years ago before working
at Extend Health. I used to consider myself a back-end systems developer,
feeling it was important to have specialization in order to differentiate myself
and provide a chance to develop focused and in-depth experience. I also fooled
myself into thinking that I preferred this designation because web development
was trivial and only the hardest and most worthwhile problems were in the
back-end systems. Instead, I merely lacked some meaningful experience with
front-end web development, which is harder to come by in the typical work
enivronment I described above. However in my current employment, I&#8217;ve become a
much more well-rounded software developer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not entirely positive if our environment and team dynamic were
intentionally setup to ensure we were all well-rounded developers (though every
other good aspect of our dev culture seems to have been carefully pieced
together by <a href="http://coreykaylor.com/">Corey</a>). Regardless, I am appreciatevly
taking note of the advantageous results of such a configuration. This is one
very important aspect of true job satisfaction and also in avoiding high
turnover and attrition in workforce.</p>

		<p>As a dev team, we have been watching and discussing various training videos and
conference talks every morning for a few months now. This week we watched a
recorded conference talk by Ruby developer <a href="http://kytrinyx.com/">Katrina Owen</a>
entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4dlF0kcThQ">Therapeutic Refactoring</a>.
I was especially impressed with her strategy for refactoring legacy code.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure everyone can agree that the safest way to refactor code and be 100%
positive that the functionality hasn&#8217;t regressed is to have a good suite of
tests. And if you don&#8217;t have sufficient test coverage (or any at all), then now
is the right time to add it before refactoring.</p>

<p>However, I have found myself skipping this step in the past, feeling justified
because the quality of the code was so poor or the deadline was so short. It is
irresponsible of me to assume that I have not changed the functionality of the
code without proof in the form of passing tests that sufficiently cover all
scenarios and use cases.  Nonetheless, watching Katrina&#8217;s presentation has
given me renewed commitment and a sound plan of attack against legacy code that
may be ugly and very unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p>Here is the example method that Katrina uses during her presentation (which is
later revealed as a piece of code that she vaguely remembers coding herself and
now abhors):</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    module XYZService

      def self.xyz_filename(target)
        # File format:
        # [day of month zero-padded][three-letter prefix] \
        # _[kind]_[age_if_kind_personal]_[target.id] \
        # _[8 random chars]_[10 first chars of title].jpg
        filename = "#{target.publish_on.strftime("%d")}"
        filename << "#{target.xyz_category_prefix}"
        filename << "#{target.kind.gsub("_", "")}"
        filename << "_%03d" % (target.age || 0) if target.personal?
        filename << "_#{target.id.to_s}"
        filename << "_#{Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(rand(10000).to_s)[0,8]}"
        truncated_title = target.title.gsub(/[^\[a-z\]]/i, '').downcase
        truncate_to = truncated_title.length > 9 ? 9 : truncated_title.length
        filename << "_#{truncated_title[0..(truncate_to)]}"
        filename << ".jpg"
        return filename
      end

    end
</pre>


<p>It certainly isn&#8217;t the worst lines of code ever written and it is getting the
job done, but it is definitely not very readable and quite difficult to
understand its purpose and logic. About the only thing that can be discerned is
that it is intended to generate a filename in a specific format.</p>

<p>Katrina starts by writing a very simple and seemingly useless test (which she
calls a &#8220;Mickey Mouse test&#8221; in her GitHub commit message) in order to begin test
coverage of this method:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    require_relative './xyz_service'

    describe XYZService do

      let(:target) do
        stub(:target)
      end

      subject { XYZService.xyz_filename(target) }

      it 'works' do
        subject.should eq('something')
      end

    end
</pre>


<p>Without much knowledge of what this method&#8217;s purpose or inputs are, we can only
pass in an empty stub object as input and then assert something rediculous for
the result. We expect this test to not only fail to pass, but it is also likely
to error during runtime (or even at compile time if in a statically typed
language like C#). The idea is to create a quick feedback loop that aids us in
finding the context and inputs required to make the code execute without runtime
error. Then we can finally see the actual return value and modify our dummy
assertion to begin expecting that output.</p>

<p>After iterating in this fashion, Katrina arrives at the following test which is
a bit more useful:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    require_relative './xyz_service'
    require 'date'

    describe XYZService do

      let(:target) do
        messages = {
          :publish_on => Date.new(2012, 3, 14),
          :xyz_category_prefix => 'abc',
          :kind => 'unicorn',
          :personal? => false,
          :id => 1337,
          :title => 'magic & superglue'
        }
        stub(:target, messages)
      end

      subject { XYZService.xyz_filename(target) }

      it 'works' do
        subject.should eq('14abcunicorn_1337_cb6c53bc_magicsuper.jpg')
      end

    end
</pre>


<p>However, this test doesn&#8217;t pass because the <code>cb6c53bc</code> portion of the resultant
filename is different every execution of the test. A simple regex allows the
test to pass all of the time:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    subject.should match(/14abcunicorn_1337_[0-9a-f]{8}_magicsuper\.jpg/)
</pre>


<p>Even though we now have a passing test, we have not yet exercised the different
input values and all code paths and branches through the method. This must be
done in order to fully understand, document, and test cover the logic and
purpose of the method. This would be done in the normal unit testing fashion
that is shown in just about every testing demo by adding more test scenarios and
assertions that excercise the varying use cases.</p>

<p>One interesting development that occurred while Katrina was using this process
was that she actually found a bug in the implementation of the original
<code>xyz_filename</code> method, specifically an extra set of braces in the regex on line
14.</p>

<p>Now that we are fully covered with tests (and a bug fixed), we are free to
refactor the code into smaller, more readable chunks of code logic that are more
cohesive and more reusable as well. This is what Katrina does for the remainder
of her presentation, and it is just as instructive as this first part. However,
today I wanted to focus on her strategy for writing test coverage against a
legacy codebase.</p>

<p>I like how what Katrina is demonstrating seems to utilize a black box testing
approach at first, and then progresses to a more white box approach as we begin
to explore the different parts of the implementation. Perhaps such a strategy
should have been obvious to me, but Katrina&#8217;s conference talk really struck a
chord with me and encouraged me to commit to doing better with test coverage in
legacy codebases before I begin making modifications or additions.</p>

<p>I highly recommend viewing the entire video, as it is only 30 minutes long and
an entertaining watch.</p>
